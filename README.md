# O-index
This project started in Neurohackademy, Seattle in August 2023 (http://neurohackademy.org/). The goal of this project is to create an automated interface  where you can type a name, and be given an o-index.

An o-index is a comrehensive rating of how open a scientist is. This mimics the h-index, but weights the scientist on if they have open source articles, share code, etc.
